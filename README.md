# Bike-Buyer-Excel-Project
In this Project I clean up the data set by removing duplicates, inserting calculated columns by using Nested IF Statements and created a dashboard using pivot tables.
This Dashboard gives the report reader insight on the trend of bike sales in different demographics for example among the Married Vs Single, Low-income Vs High-Income earners among other insights.
